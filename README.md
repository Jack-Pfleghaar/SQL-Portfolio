# SQL Portfollio
A portfollio of projects and assignments I have created to help demonstrate my proficiencies!

All projects were made during the duration of my time in a database security class which was taught by Dr. Greg Gogolin at Ferris State University.

The files listed as SQL1 through SQL4 are individual assignments I created while in my database security class.
